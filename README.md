# Weather-App

## Description
This is a Web Application built for my class Web Application Programming utilizing Bootstrap, jQuery, Ajax, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and PHP. This project consists of three main HTML pages. This project uses two APIs: [TomTom Fuzzy Search](https://developer.tomtom.com/search-api/documentation/search-service/fuzzy-search) and [OpenWeather 5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).

## Index

## History
All previous searches are stored in a database so on this page, a user can lookup and find all searches conducted on a single day. The user can then see the results from these searches.

## Project status
